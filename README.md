## Description
This is a technical challenge project for the Spotify Frontend Developer Internship - Fall 2022.

tl;dr Translate is an app for folks who want to distill long meeting notes, emails, news articles and other text into quick bite-sized summaries. Users can title their tl;dr translation and submit the original text to receive back a tl;dr response from the GPT-3 AI model via OpenAI.

Users can also choose to delete their tl;drs when they are done with them!

## Technology Used
- React.js
- OpenAI API
- CSS3

## Deployment

tl;dr Translate is deployed via Surge and can be accessed [here](tldr-translate.surge.sh)!

## Future Additions
- Add ability for user to save their tl;dr
- Allow for user to have control over which AI engine they choose and provide information about each
- Incorporate local storage so that a user's tl;drs will persist on refresh
- Add responsive design
